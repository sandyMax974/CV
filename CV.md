## SANDY POUNOUSSAMY

I'm a junior software developer with a background in digital advertising. Early on in my career, I started to grow an appetite for the tech aspect of it. Being a fast-learner and curious individual, I rapidly progressed to become the company's AdTech implementation expert. I got involved in long term strategical projects and worked heavily with engineers, which helped developed a passion for coding.

This led me to start my career change, and after a year to prepare for the transition, I enrolled at Makers Academy in early January. A bootcamp focusing on language agnostic software design principles and agile best practices. Having graduated in April, I'm ready to take on new challenges and embark on my Junior Software Developer's adventure, super keen to start creating my own solutions, dive into more complex codebases and fix bugs with my own hands.

## Hobbies

- I'm obsessed with food programs like Masterchef Professionals, Chef's Table, Great British Menu, etc. I like trying to cook new dishes as seen, but there is nothing I enjoy more than one of a kind dinning experience :bento: :stew: :sushi: :cut_of_meat:
- I'm a big fan of Japanese animes such as, Attack On Titans, My Hero Acadmia or Demon Slayer to only name a few. I also collect comics (mainly the classics DC's and Marvel's) and I'm currently building my own little librairy but I'm sadly running out of space... 
- And when it comes to moving my body, I enjoy a good boxing / kick-boxing session and the occasional sparring :boxing_glove: :martial_arts_uniform:
